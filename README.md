# Visual tier list
Some project me and a friend hacked together in a few hours. Based on [JustLolaMan's and M0bieus's tier list](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/d90vbq/draft_eld_draft_tier_list_from_infinite_mythic/) I got annoyed there were no actual card to show, so I decided to make my own visualization :D.

Please note that the code is hideous, but like I mentioned, we hacked this together in a few hours.

Thanks to CrabApples/Annihilatious for the design and [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) for their excellent API.

Tool is (for now) available [here](https://www.cardsolutions.nl/jonas/index.php)
